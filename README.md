# Chapter 1. A Pragmatic Philosophy
**Tip 1: Care About Your Craft**

We feel that there is no point in developing software unless you care about doing it well

**Tip 2: Think! About Your Work**

Think about what you're doing while you're doing it. Never run on auto-pilot. Constantly think about and critique your work in real-time.

## 1.-It's Your Life
Software development must appear close to the top of any list of any careers where you have control. But, for some reason, developers seem to resist change.

**Tip 3: You Have Agency**

## 2.-The Cat Ate My Source Code

### Team trust

### Take responsibility

**Tip 4: Provide Options, Don't Make Lame Excuses**

Don't say it can't be done, explain what can be done to salvage the situation.

## 3.-Software Entropy

The industry gives you a remarkable set of opportunities. Be proactive, and take them.

**Tip 5: Don't Live with Broken Windows**

Fix "broken windows" as soon as it is discovered. Neglect accelerates the software rot faster than any other factor. If you find yourself on a project where the code is pristinely beautiful, you will likely take extra special care to not mess it up.

## 4.-Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs

**Tip 6: Be a Catalyst for Change**

Most software disasters start out too small to notice, and most project overruns happen a day at a time. Determine whether you're making good or doing harm when you try to catalyze change.

**Tip 7: Remember the Big Picture**

Keep an eye on the big picture. Constantly review what's happening around you, not just what you personally are doing.

## 5.-Good enough soup

The scope and quality of the system you produce should be discussed as part of that system's requirements.

**Tip 8: Make Quality a Requirements Issue**

Great software today is often preferable to the fantasy of perfect software tomorrow. If you give users something to play with early, their feedback will often lead you to a better eventual solution.

## 6.-Your Knowledge Portfolio

* Serious investors invest regularlyâ€”as a habit.
* Diversification is the key to long-term success.
* Smart investors balance their portfolios between conservative and high-risk,high-reward investments.
* Investors try to buy low and sell high for maximum return.
* Portfolios should be reviewed and rebalanced periodically


### Building Your Portfolio
* Invest regularly
* Diversify
* Manage risk
* Buy low, sell High
* Review and rebalance

**Tip 9: Invest Regularly in Your Knowledge Portfolio**

### Goals
* Learn at least one new language every year.
* Read a technical book each quarter.
* Read nontechnical books, too.
* Take classes.
* Participate in local user groups and meetups.
* Experiment with different environments.
* Stay current.

It's important to **continue investing**. It doesn't matter whether you ever use any of these technologies on a project, or even whether you put them on resume. The process of learning will expand your thinking, opening you to new possibilities and new way of doing things. 

### Critical Thinking

You need to ensure that the knowledge in your portfolio is accurate and unswayed by either vendor or media hype.

**Tip 10: Critically Analyze What You Read and Hear**

* Ask the "Five Whys"
* Who does this benefit?
* What's the context?
* When or Where would this work?
* Why is this a problem?

## 7.-Communicate

Write natural language as you would write code.

**Tip 11: English is Just Another Programming Language**

### Know Your Audience

You're communicating only if you're conveying what do you mean to convey. You need to understand the needs, interests, and capabilities of your audience.

Don't wait for questions (for the feedback): ask for them.

### Know What You Want To Say

Plan what you want to say. Write an outline. Then ask yourself, "Does this communicate what I want to express to my audience in a way that works for them?" Refine it until it does.

### Choose Your Moment

You need to work out what your audience's priorities are to understand what your audience needs to hear

### Choose A Style

Adjust the style of your delivery to suit your audience.

### Make It Look Good

Find the best way to convey your ideas to the audience

### Involve Your Audience

If possible, involve your readers with early drafts of your document. Get their feedback, and pick their brains. You'll build a good working relationship and you'll probably produce a better document in the process.

### Be A Listener

Encourage people to talk by asking questions, or ask them to restate the discussion in their own words.

### Get Back to People

Keeping people informed makes them far more forgiving of the occasional slip, make them feel that you haven't forgotten them.

**Tip 12: It's Both What You Say and the Way You Say It**

The more effective that communication, the more influential you become.

### Documentation

Document is an integral part of the overall development process. Keep code and documentation together.

**Tip 13: Build Document In, Don't Bolt It On**
