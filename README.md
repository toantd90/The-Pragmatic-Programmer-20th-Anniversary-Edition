# Chapter 1. A Pragmatic Philosophy
**Tip 1: Care About Your Craft**

We feel that there is no point in developing software unless you care about doing it well

**Tip 2: Think! About Your Work**

Think about what you're doing while you're doing it. Never run on auto-pilot. Constantly think about and critique your work in real-time.

## 1.-It's Your Life
Software development must appear close to the top of any list of any careers where you have control. But, for some reason, developers seem to resist change.

**Tip 3: You Have Agency**

## 2.-The Cat Ate My Source Code

### Team trust

### Take responsibility

**Tip 4: Provide Options, Don't Make Lame Excuses**

Don't say it can't be done, explain what can be done to salvage the situation.

## 3.-Software Entropy

The industry gives you a remarkable set of opportunities. Be proactive, and take them.

**Tip 5: Don't Live with Broken Windows**

Fix "broken windows" as soon as it is discovered. Neglect accelerates the software rot faster than any other factor. If you find yourself on a project where the code is pristinely beautiful, you will likely take extra special care to not mess it up.

## 4.-Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs

**Tip 6: Be a Catalyst for Change**

Most software disasters start out too small to notice, and most project overruns happen a day at a time. Determine whether you're making good or doing harm when you try to catalyze change.

**Tip 7: Remember the Big Picture**

Keep an eye on the big picture. Constantly review what's happening around you, not just what you personally are doing.

## 5.-Good enough soup

The scope and quality of the system you produce should be discussed as part of that system's requirements.

**Tip 8: Make Quality a Requirements Issue**

Great software today is often preferable to the fantasy of perfect software tomorrow. If you give users something to play with early, their feedback will often lead you to a better eventual solution.

## 6.-Your Knowledge Portfolio

* Serious investors invest regularlyâ€”as a habit.
* Diversification is the key to long-term success.
* Smart investors balance their portfolios between conservative and high-risk,high-reward investments.
* Investors try to buy low and sell high for maximum return.
* Portfolios should be reviewed and rebalanced periodically


### Building Your Portfolio
* Invest regularly
* Diversify
* Manage risk
* Buy low, sell High
* Review and rebalance

**Tip 9: Invest Regularly in Your Knowledge Portfolio**

### Goals
* Learn at least one new language every year.
* Read a technical book each month.
* Read nontechnical books, too.
* Take classes.
* Participate in local user groups and meetups.
* Experiment with different environments.
* Stay current.

It's important to **continue investing**. It doesn't matter whether you ever use any of these technologies on a project, or even whether you put them on resume. The process of learning will expand your thinking, opening you to new possibilities and new way of doing things. 

### Critical Thinking

You need to ensure that the knowledge in your portfolio is accurate and unswayed by either vendor or media hype.

**Tip 10: Critically Analyze What You Read and Hear**

* Ask the "Five Whys"
* Who does this benefit?
* What's the context?
* When or Where would this work?
* Why is this a problem?

## 7.-Communicate

Write natural language as you would write code.

**Tip 11: English is Just Another Programming Language**

### Know Your Audience

You're communicating only if you're conveying what do you mean to convey. You need to understand the needs, interests, and capabilities of your audience.

Don't wait for questions (for the feedback): ask for them.

### Know What You Want To Say

Plan what you want to say. Write an outline. Then ask yourself, "Does this communicate what I want to express to my audience in a way that works for them?" Refine it until it does.

### Choose Your Moment

You need to work out what your audience's priorities are to understand what your audience needs to hear

### Choose A Style

Adjust the style of your delivery to suit your audience.

### Make It Look Good

Find the best way to convey your ideas to the audience

### Involve Your Audience

If possible, involve your readers with early drafts of your document. Get their feedback, and pick their brains. You'll build a good working relationship and you'll probably produce a better document in the process.

### Be A Listener

Encourage people to talk by asking questions, or ask them to restate the discussion in their own words.

### Get Back to People

Keeping people informed makes them far more forgiving of the occasional slip, make them feel that you haven't forgotten them.

**Tip 12: It's Both What You Say and the Way You Say It**

The more effective that communication, the more influential you become.

### Documentation

Document is an integral part of the overall development process. Keep code and documentation together.

**Tip 13: Build Document In, Don't Bolt It On**

# Chapter 2. A Pragmatic Approach

## 8.-The Essence of Good Design

**Tip 14: Good Design Is Easier to Change Than Bad Design**

Every design principle out there is a special case of ETC

### ETC Is A Value, Not A Rule

You need to deliberately asking yourself "did the thing I just did make the overall system easier or harder to change?"

* Try to make what you write replaceable, keeping the code decoupled and cohesive

* Note the situation in your engineering day book: the choices you have and some guesses about change

## 9.-DRY-The Evils of Duplication

Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.

**Tip 15: DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself**

### DRY Is More Than Code

DRY is about the duplication of knowledge, of intent. It's about expressing the same thing in two different places, possibly in two totally different ways.

### Duplication In Code

```js
function printBalance(account) {
  console.log(`Debits: ${account.debits.toFixed(2)}`);
  console.log(`Credits: ${account.credits.toFixed(2)}`);

  if (account.fees < 0) {
    console.log(`Fees: ${-account.fees.toFixed(2)}`);
  } else {
    console.log(`Fees: ${account.fees.toFixed(2)}`);
  }
  console.log("---------");
  if (account.balance < 0) {
    console.log(`Fees: -${account.balance.toFixed(2)}`);
  } else {
    console.log(`Balance: -${account.balance.toFixed(2)}`);
  }
}
```

We can improve the code by 

- Adding `formatAmount` function to handle format and negative numbers for us.

- Adding `reportLine` function to handle label format

```js
function formatAmount(value) {
  let result = value.toFixed(2);
  if (value < 0) {
    return `-${result}`;
  }
  return result;
}

function reportLine(label, value) {
  console.log(`${label}: ${formatAmount(value)}`);
}

function printBalance({ debits, credits, fees, balance }) {
  reportLine("Debits", debits);
  reportLine("Credits", credits);
  reportLine("Fees", fees);
  console.log("---------");
  reportLine("Balance", balance);
}
```

### Not All Code Duplication is Knowledge Duplication

If the code is the same, but the knowledge they represent is different. That's a coincidence, not a duplication.

### Duplication In Documentation

Ask yourself what the comment adds to the code. If it compensates for bad naming and layout then renaming the variable

### DRY Violations In Data

**Tip 16: Make It Easy to Reuse**

If it isn't easy, people won't do it. And if you fail to reuse, you risk duplicating knowledge.

## 10.-Orthogonality

#### A Nonorthogonal System

Nonorthogonal systems are inherently more complex to change and control. When components of any system are highly interdependent, there is no such thing as a local fix.

### Benefit Of Orthogonality

**Gain Productivity**

* Changes are localized, so development and testing time are reduced.
* An orthogonal approach promotes reuse.
* There is a fairly subtle gain in productivity when you combine orthogonal components.

**Reduce Risk**

* Diseased sections of code are isolated.
* The resulting system is less fragile.
* An orthogonal system will probably better tested.
* You will not be as tightly tied to a particular vendor, product or platform

**Tip 17: Eliminate Effects Between Unrelated Things**

### Design

*If I dramatically change the requirements behind a particular function, how many modules are affected?*

Ask yourself how decoupled your design is from changes in the real world. *Don't rely on the properties of things you can't control*

### Toolkits And Libraries

Be careful to preserve the orthogonality of your system as you introduce third-party toolkits and libraries.

### Coding

* Keep your code decoupled
* Avoid global data
* Avoid similar functions

### Testing

### Documentation

### Living With Orthogonality

## 11.-Reversibility

We don't always make the best decisions the first time around

**Tip 18: There Are No Final Decisions**

### Flexible architecture

While many people try to keep their code flexible, you also need to think about maintaining flexibility in the areas of architecture, deployment and vendor integration.

**Tip 19: Forgo Following Fads**

No one knows what the future may hold, especially not us! Be prepared for changes

## 12.-Tracer Bullets

User requirements may be vague, because your users have never seen a system like this before. 

### Code that glows in the dark

Look for the important requirements, the ones that define the system. Look for the areas where you have doubts, and where you see the biggest risks. Then prioritize your development so that these are the first areas you code.

**Tip 20: Use Tracer Bullets to Find the Target**

Tracer development is an incremental approach. 

Advantages of tracer development are:

* Users can see something working early â€” users can see visible progress toward their system, regardless if there is a lack of functionality.
* Developers build a structure for their work â€” tracer development produces an outline of the requirements embodied in code.
* You have an integration platform â€” you have an environment in which you can add new pieces of code after unit-testing. A system connected end-to-end makes integration faster and more accurate.
* You have something to demonstrate â€” when working with clients who expect demos during every meeting, simply demonstrate the tracer code.
* You get a better feel for progress â€” tracer development allows developers to take multiple small cases, one at a time. This allows for performance to be measured much easier and demonstrates progress to your users.

### Tracer Bullets Don't Always Hit Their Target

The use of tracer development doesnâ€™t always provide guaranteed results, however it is a technique that can be used when youâ€™re not 100% certain of where youâ€™re going. Typically, you should use tracer development in a new project with little direction regarding requirement implementation. Like with tracer bullets, you can still miss the target and that is fine. Work on how to change what needs to be changed in order to get closer to target.

### Tracer Code Versus Protyping

The key differences between tracer development and prototyping are:

* Prototyping is disposable. Tracer development is not.
* Tracer code isnâ€™t fully functional, but forms part of an applications skeleton.
* Prototyping doesnâ€™t necessarily have done with code. They can be written on whiteboards, index cards, etc.
* Prototyping involves more planning and brainstorming, while tracer development takes on a more make-something-out-of-nothing approach. Adjustments can be made to be closer on target.

## 13.-Prototype and Post-it Notes

We build software prototypes to analyze and expose risk, and to offer chances for correction at a greatly reduced cost.

### Things To Prototype

* Architecture
* New functionality in an existing system
* Structure or conentents of external data
* Third-party tools or components
* Performance issues
* User interface design

Prototyping is a learning experience. Its value lies not in the code produced, but it the lessons learned. That's really the point of prototyping.

**Tip 21: Prototype to Learn**

### How To Use Prototypes

Avoid details:
* Correctness
* Completeness
* Robustness
* Style

### Protyping Architecture

* Are the responsibilities of the major components well defined and appropriate?
* Are the collaborations between major components well defined?
* Is coupling minimized?
* Can you identify potential sources of duplication?
* Are interface definitions and constraints acceptable?
* Does every module have an access path to the data it needs during execution? Does it have that access when it needs it?

## 14.-Domain Languages

Domain Languages refers to specialized languages or notations that are tailored to a specific problem domain or industry. These languages are designed to express concepts and operations in a way that is intuitive and natural for domain experts, making it easier to communicate and work with complex ideas within that particular field.

Domain languages are often created to bridge the gap between technical implementation and the problem domain itself. By using a domain language, developers can write code that closely resembles the language and terminology used by domain experts, making it easier for them to understand and validate the software.

**Tip 22: Program Close to the Problem Domain**

## 15.-Estimating

By mastering estimation and developing an intuitive sense of magnitudes, you can demonstrate the apparent capability to assess feasibility.

**Tip 23: Estimate to Avoid Surprises**

### How Accurate Is Accurate Enough?
**First:** Do they need high accuracy, or are they looking for a ballpark figure?

**Second:** Scale time estimates properly

| Duration   	| Quote estimate in                    	|
|------------	|--------------------------------------	|
| 1-15 days  	| days                                 	|
| 3-6 weeks  	| weeks                                	|
| 8-20 weeks 	| months                               	|
| 20+ weeks  	| think hard before giving an estimate 	|

### Where Do Estimates Come From?

Ask someone who's been in a similar situation in the past.

* Understand What's Being Asked
* Build a Model of the System
* Break the Model into Components
* Give Each Parameter a Value
* Calculate the Answers
* Keep Track of Your Estimating Prowess

### Estimating Project Schedules

Two techniques for reducing uncertainty

**Painting the Missile**
Using a range of values like *optimistic*, *most likely* and *pessimistic* *estimate* is a great way to avoid the estimation error.

**Eating the Elephant**
The only way to determine the timetable for a project is by gaining experience on that same project. Practice incremental development, repeating the following steps:
* Check requirements
* Analyze risks (and prioritize riskiest items earlier)
* Design, implement and integrate
* Validate with users

Unless you are doing an application similar to a previous one, with the same team and the same technology, you'd just be guessing.

The refinement and confidence in the schedule gets better and better each iteration.

**Tip 24: Iterate the Schedule with the Code**

### What To Say When Asked For An Estimate

*"I'll get back to you."*

# Chapter 3. The Basic Tools

## 16.-The Power of Plain Text

We like our plain text to be understandable to humans

**Tip 25: Keep Knowledge in Plain Text**

### The Power Of Text

* Insurance Against Obsolescence
* Leverage
* Easier Testing

## 17.-Shell Games

A benefit of GUIs is **WYSIWYG**. The disadvantage is **WYSIAWYG-** What you see is *all* what you get.

**Tip 26: Use the Power of Command Shells**

## 18.-Power Editing

**Tip 27: Achieve Editor Fluency**

## 19.-Version Control

**Tip 28: Always Use Version Control**

## 20.-Debugging

### Psychology Of Debugging

Embrace the fact that debugging is just problem solving, and attack it as such.

**Tip 29: Fix the Problem, Not the Blame**

It doesn't really matter whether the bug is your fault or someone else's. It is still your problem.

### A Debugging Mindset

You need to turn off many of the defenses you use each day to protect your ego, tune out any project pressures you may be under, and get yourself comfortable.

**Tip 30: Don't Panic**

Don't waste a single neuron on the train of thought that begins "but that can't happen" because quite clearly it *can*, and has.

Always try to discover the root cause of a problem, not just this particular appearance of it.

### Where To Start

* Before *start*, make sure that you're working on code that built cleanly-without *warnings*.
* Watch the user who reported the bug in action to get sufficient level of detail.

### Debugging Strategies

**Reproducing Bugs**
* The best way to start fixing a bug is to make it reproducible.
* We want a bug that can be reproduced through short steps (*single command*).

**Tip 31: Failing Test Before Fixing Code**

**Tip 32: Read the Damn Error Message**

* Make sure you know how to move up and down the call stack and examine the local stack environment
* Keep pen and paper nearby so we can jot down notes.
* Looking at a stack trace seems to scroll on forever. There is often a quicker way to find the problem than examining each and every stack frame: use a *binary chop*. Two common bugs scenarios
	* Sensitive to Input Values
	* Regresssions Accross Releases

**Logging and/or Tracing**

Watch the state of a program or a data structure over time.

**Rubber Ducking**

Explain the bug to someone else.

**Process of Elimination**

It is possible that a bug exists in the OS, the compiler, or a third-party productâ€”but this should not be your first thought

**Tip 33: "select" Isn't Broken**

### The Element of Surprise

When faced with a "suprising" failure, you must accept that one or more of your assumption is wrong.

**Tip 34: Don't Assume It - Prove It**

* Beyond fixing the bug, you need to determine why it this failure wasn't caught earlier. Consider amend the unit or other tests so they would have caught it.
* Are there any other places that may susceptible to this same bug?
* If it took long a long time to fix this bug, *Why*? How could you make fixing this bug easier next time?
* Finally, if the bug is result of someone else's wrong assumption, discuss the problem with the whole team

### Debugging Check

* Is the problem being reported a direct result of the underlying bug, or merely asymptom?
* Is the bug really in the framework you're using? Is it in the OS? Or is it in your code?
* If you explained this problem in detail to a coworker, what would you say?
* If the suspect code passes its unit tests, are the tests complete enough? What happens if you run the tests with *this* data?
* Do the conditions that caused this bug exist anywhere else in the system?

## 21.-Text Manipulation

**Tip 35: Learn a Text Manipulation Language**

## 22.-Engineering Daybooks

Use daybooks to take notes in the meetings, to jot down what we're working on, to note variable values when debugging, to leave reminders where we put things, to record wild ideas, and sometimes just to doodle.

Main benefits:
* More reliable than memory.
* Gives you a place to store ideas that aren't immediately relevant to the task at hand.

# Chapter 4. Pragmatic Paranoia

**Tip 36: You Can't Write Perfect Software**

No one in the brief history of computing has ever written a piece of perfect software. Pragmatic Programmers don't trust themselves, either.

## 23.-Design by Contract

Every function and method in a software system does *something*. Before it start that *something*, the function may have some expectation about the state of the world before and after
* Preconditions
* Postconditions
* Class invariants

**Tip 37: Design with Contracts**

Write "lazy" code: be strict in what you will accept before you begin, and promise as little as possible in return.

### Implementing DBC

Simply enumerating at design time:

* what the input domain range is
* what the boundary conditions are
* what the routine promises to deliver (and what it doesn't)

### DBC And Crashing Early

DBC fits in nicely with our concept of crashing early.

## 24.-Dead Programs Tell No Lies

It's easy to fall into the "it can't happen" mentality. We're coding defensively. We're making many assumptions. 

All errors give you information. You could convince yourself that the error can't happen, and choose to ignore it. Instead, Pragmatic Programmers tell themselves that if there is an error, something very, very bad has happened.

**Tip 38: Crash Early**

### Crash, Don't Trash

One of the benefits of detecting problems as soon as you can is that you can crash earlier, and crashing is often the best thing you can do.

When your code discovers that something that was supposed to be impossible just happened, your program is no longer viable.

`A dead program normally does a lot less damage than a crippled one.`

## 25.-Assertive Programming

**Tip 39: Use Assertions to Prevent the Impossible**

* Assertions are also useful checks on an algorithm's operation.
* Don't use assertions in place of real error handling.
* Leave Assertions Turned On, unless you have critical performance issues.

## 26.-How to Balance Resources

We all manage resources whenever we code: memory, transactions, threads, network connections, files, timers-all kinds of things with limited availability. Most of the time, resource usage follows a predictable pattern: you allocate the resource, use it, and then deallocate it.

**Tip 40: Finish What You Start**

When in doubt, it always pays to reduce scope.

**Tip 41: Act Locally**

### Nest Allocations

* Deallocate resources in the opposite order to that in which you allocate them.
* When allocating the same set of resources in different places in your code, always allocate them in the same order (prevent deadlocks)

### Balancing And Exceptions

If an exception is thrown, how do you guarantee that everything allocated prior to the exception is tidied up?:
* Use variable scrope
* Use a `finally` clause in a `try...catch` block

## 27.-Don't Outrun Your Headlights

We can't see too far ahead into the future, and the further off-axis you look, the darker it gets. 

**Tip 42: Take Small Steps-Always**

Always take small, deliberate steps, checking for feedback and adjusting before proceeding. Never take on a step or a task that's "too big".

**Tip 43: Avoid Fortune-Telling**

Much of the time, tomorrow looks a lot like today. But don't count on it
